/**
 * Vinta School OS — PIN step
 *
 * The PIN half of a destructive confirmation, on its own so it can be dropped
 * into whichever dialog is asking: the shared `PinConfirmDialog`, or the
 * existing session dialogs that already have their own wording and reason
 * fields and must NOT grow a second stacked modal on top.
 *
 * This is not a new digit widget — it drives the existing `ui/PINInput`, which
 * already handles auto-advance, backspace, paste, arrow keys and the shake.
 *
 * Verification lives here, not in the caller: every consumer wants the same
 * four things (check the PIN, show why if it is wrong, clear the boxes, hand
 * control back), and three copies of that would eventually disagree.

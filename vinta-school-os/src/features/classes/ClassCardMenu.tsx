/**
 * Vinta School OS — the ☰ on a Classrooms card
 *
 * The Classrooms tab lists GROUPS, not sessions, and that is the whole reason
 * it had no burger, no Start Class and no free-session flag while the Dashboard
 * had all three: SessionMenu takes a session, and nothing in this tab was one.
 * The tab showed a group's weekly template — recurring slots, not dates — so
 * there was no instance for the menu to act on.
 *
 * This component resolves that missing piece. It asks the server for the
 * group's next session (GET /sessions?class_id=) and hands it to SessionMenu,
 * which then offers the same menu a session card on the Dashboard offers.
 *
 * The lookup is per card and local to the card. A group's sessions belong to
 * that group alone, and when the menu changes one it is this card that has to
 * reload — a page-wide cache would only add a way to go stale.
 *
 * That read is also why the running lamp lives here rather than on the card
 * itself: "is this group live right now" is a fact about its sessions, and
 * this is the only part of a Classrooms card that has them. One fetch feeds
 * both the lamp and the menu, so the two cannot tell different stories.

 *
 * This used to be a two-colour lamp — green live, red idle — and the red one
 * was the bug the desk reported. It sat immediately beside the card's other
 * dot, the activity state the server sends as `status_color`, so every
 * ordinary group wore a green dot and a red dot at the same time with nothing
 * to say which was which. Red is read as a fault; "this group meets on
 * Thursday and today is Tuesday" is not one, and it is the state of almost
 * every card at almost every moment. A fault light that is on 95% of the time
 * carries no information at all.
 *
 * So the lamp speaks only when it has something to say. A group that is live
 * gets a pulsing green dot — a real, rare, actionable fact, and the same one
 * that unlocks "End Class" in the ☰ beside it. A group that is not gets
 * nothing, and the card is left with a single dot whose meaning is unambiguous
 * because there is only one of it.
 *
 * Amber is the other half of the same fix. A class whose end time has passed
 * is *still* `in_progress` on the server — nothing closes a class on a timer
 * (`tasks/cron_jobs.py` deliberately does not; ending a class is what settles
 * money and it is PIN-gated) — so a lamp reading the status alone went on
 * pulsing green for a class that finished at nine. Green now means running and
 * amber means "this one is over and needs a decision", which is the same fact
 * the ☰ beside it is waiting to act on.
 *
 * It is a different colour rather than the same dot with a different label
 * because the desk reads this corner at a glance from across the room, and the
 * two call for opposite actions: extend the class, or close it. It does not
 * pulse — a pulse says "happening now", and what is happening is that nothing
 * is. `--gold` matches the "unscheduled" mark in `ClassGrid`, so amber already
 * means attention in this tab, not running.
 *
 * `unknown` (the first read has not landed) renders nothing for the same
 * reason it always did: guessing would be inventing a fact.

 * the PIN, so a card that passed no handler would look like a dead menu item.

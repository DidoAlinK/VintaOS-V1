/**
 * Vinta School OS — Student Types
 *
 * The billing half of this file mirrors the contract served by
 * `GET /students` (list) and `GET /students/<id>` (detail). Two rules shape it:
 *
 *   1. `status` describes money that has ACTUALLY been recorded. It is never
 *      optimistic. A student with nothing on file reads `unpaid` or `no_plan`,
 *      never `paid`.
 *   2. `plan` / `plan_amount` / `sessions*` / `billing_model` / `group_name`
 *      describe the plan the student is ON. That is owned by the group they are
 *      enrolled in, so it is populated even before any payment exists.
 *
 * Keeping those two ideas apart is the whole point: the old shape conflated them
 * and reported a 9,000 DA "Term" plan, marked Paid, for students who had never
 * paid and were not on that plan.

 * - `unpaid`       yellow — present, but nothing covered the day. The signal
 *                           the desk acts on: they came and were not paid for.
 * - `absent`       red    — the register says they were not there.
 * - `upcoming`     grey   — has not happened yet; the register is empty by
 *                           design, not by neglect.
 * - `cancelled`    — the group did not meet. Outranks the register.
 * - `not_enrolled` — a session of a group they had not joined yet.
 * - `unrecorded`   — it is past and no register was ever taken, so there is no
 *                    fact about this student to show. Deliberately neither
 *                    green, red, nor yellow.

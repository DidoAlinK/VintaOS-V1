## 1. System Overview

Vinta School OS is a **multi-tenant SaaS** where each academy is an isolated tenant. All data (students, teachers, classes, billing, logs) is scoped to a single academy. The system has two user roles: **Owner** (full control) and **Staff/Front Desk** (operational access with PIN-based accountability).

### What the system manages:

| Domain | Core function |
|---|---|
| Student Management | Profiles, guardians, enrollment, attendance, billing |
| Teacher Management | Profiles, contracts, hours tracking, payroll |
| Class/Room Tracking | Class definitions, room assignments, capacity, schedules |
| Weekly Calendar | Recurring session scheduling, drag-to-resize, session instances |
| Check-in/Check-out | Manual attendance per session, auto check-out at scheduled end |
| Billing | Per-student tuition, payment tracking, renewal cycles, overdue alerts |
| Activity Log | Every action attributed to the staff member via PIN |
| Settings | Academy config, staff roles, billing defaults, automations |

---

## 2. Tenant Model

```
Academy (tenant)
  └── All other entities are scoped to this academy via academy_id FK
```

**Academy** is the root entity. Every student, teacher, class, billing record, and log entry belongs to exactly one academy. There is no cross-academy data sharing.

---

## 3. Core Entities

### 3.1 Academy

The top-level tenant. One academy = one private school/academy.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | UUID / PK | Unique academy identifier |
| name | string | "École Al Amal" |
| phone | string | Academy contact number |
| email | string | Contact email |
| address | string | Physical address |
| weekend_day | integer | Day-of-week considered weekend (5=Friday for Algeria) |
| current_term | string | e.g., "2025 — Fall term" |
| created_at | timestamp | |
| updated_at | timestamp | |

---

### 3.2 User (Staff & Owner profiles)

Every person who logs into the system. The owner is the academy creator; staff are front-desk operators.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | UUID / PK | |
| academy_id | FK → Academy | Tenant scope |
| name | string | Full name |
| email | string | Login email |
| phone | string | Contact number (optional) |
| role | enum | `owner` \| `staff` |
| pin_hash | string | 4-digit PIN hash — required for ALL roles (owner PIN = login, staff PIN = action attribution) |
| picture | JSON (nullable) | `{ type: 'preset', colors: [hex1, hex2] }` or `{ type: 'upload', dataUrl: '...' }` |
| avatar_color_1 | string | Gradient start color for avatar (legacy, prefer `picture` field) |
| avatar_color_2 | string | Gradient end color for avatar (legacy, prefer `picture` field) |
| is_active | boolean | Soft-delete / deactivation flag |
| created_at | timestamp | |
| updated_at | timestamp | |

**Key behavior:** The PIN is the core differentiator. Every logged action (check-in, billing, etc.) is attributed to the user who entered their PIN, making the activity log a real accountability guarantee.

---

### 3.3 Student

| notes | text | Free-form (e.g., "Mild peanut allergy") |
| created_at | timestamp | |
| updated_at | timestamp | |

**Computed / derived fields (not stored, calculated at query time):**

|---|---|---|
| id | UUID / PK | |
| academy_id | FK → Academy | Tenant scope |
| name | string | Display name: "Math — CM2" |

## 5. Tab-by-Tab Data Flows

### 5.1 Dashboard Tab

**What it shows:**
- Weekly agenda (Google Calendar-style block grid)
- Session detail with student roster
- Activity log sidebar

**Data dependencies:**
```
Sessions ──► Class ──► Teacher, Classroom
     │
     └──► SessionStudent ──► Student
                │
                └──► payment_status (snapshot)

ActivityLog ──► User (who performed action)
```

**Data flows:**
1. **Load agenda:** Query all Sessions for the current week, grouped by day. Each session carries its class, teacher, and room info.
2. **Open session detail:** Query SessionStudents for that session, joined with Student data for names/phones.
3. **Toggle presence:** Update SessionStudent.is_present, record checked_in_at/checked_out_at, create ActivityLog entry.
4. **Cycle payment:** Update SessionStudent.payment_status, create ActivityLog entry.
5. **Drag to reschedule:** Update Session.start_time, end_time, date. Creates ActivityLog entry.
6. **Add custom session:** Create a new Session with schedule_id=null. Creates ActivityLog entry.
7. **Add student to session:** Create SessionStudent record. If student doesn't exist, create Student first. Creates ActivityLog entry.
8. **Class ending toast:** At scheduled end time, check if session exists and status is in_progress → trigger notification.
9. **Auto check-out:** If auto_checkout_enabled in AcademySettings, automatically set checked_out_at for all SessionStudents when session end_time is reached.

- Student profile drawer with billing calendar

**Data dependencies:**
```
Student ──► Guardian (1:N)
Student ──► Enrollment ──► Class (M:N)
Student ──► StudentBilling ──► PaymentPlan
Student ──► SessionStudent (attendance history)
```

**Data flows:**
1. **List students:** Query all Students for academy, compute status from latest StudentBilling, compute sessions count from SessionStudent.
2. **Stats rail:** Aggregate counts: total, paid (status=paid), overdue (status=overdue).
3. **Filter:** Client-side filter on computed status field.
4. **Open drawer:** Load Student + Guardians + latest StudentBilling + enrollment list.
5. **Billing calendar:** Query StudentBilling records for last 4 weeks, render as mini-grid (paid=green, missed=red, upcoming=grey).
6. **Call/Message:** Use student.phone / parent_phone from Guardian.
7. **Delete student:** Soft-delete Student, cascade withdraw all Enrollments, mark SessionStudents as withdrawn.
8. **Add student:** Create Student + default Guardian + default StudentBilling (status=paid, 0 sessions).

---

### 5.3 Teachers Tab

**What it shows:**
- Teacher directory with stats rail
- Teacher profile drawer with schedule + payroll summary

**Data dependencies:**
```
Teacher ──► Class (1:N, as teacher_id)
Teacher ──► TeacherPayroll (1:N)
Teacher ──► TeacherHoursLog ──► Session
Teacher ──► Session (1:N, as session.teacher_id)
```

**Data flows:**
1. **List teachers:** Query all Teachers for academy, compute contract badge, hours/sudents count.
2. **Stats rail:** Total, hourly count, per-student count.
3. **Open drawer:** Load Teacher + assigned Classes + TeacherPayroll for current period + TeacherHoursLog this week.
4. **Schedule view:** Query Sessions where teacher_id matches, grouped by day/time.
5. **Payroll summary:** For hourly: total_hours × hourly_rate. For per-student: active_students × per_student_rate.
6. **Add teacher:** Create Teacher with default contract_type=hourly, rate=0.

---

### 5.4 Classes Tab

**What it shows:**
- Grid of class cards
- Class detail with editable header + block calendar

**Data dependencies:**
```
Class ──► Teacher (FK, nullable)
Class ──► Schedule (1:N) ──► Classroom
Class ──► Enrollment ──► Student (M:N)
Class ──► Session (1:N)
```

**Data flows:**
1. **Grid view:** Query all Classes, compute enrolled count from Enrollment, compute status dot color.
2. **Status dot logic** — what is happening in the group today, not how full it is:
   - Amber / **Scheduled**: students enrolled and a weekly slot exists; the class has not started.
   - Green / **Active**: a session of this group is `in_progress` (today) and at least one student is marked present.
   - Red / **Empty**: a session is `in_progress` and nobody is present, or the group has students and no weekly slot at all (it can never run).
   - Grey / **Empty**: nobody enrolled — nothing to teach.
   - The word "Empty" is shared by the grey and red states; the dot carries which is which.
   - Capacity is no longer a status. It was Red at `enrolled ≥ capacity`, which painted a
     full group that was running with everyone present the same colour as one that never
     meets. It is still shown as the enrollment bar on the card, and as `capacity` /
     `enrolled_count` on the payload.
   - "No schedule" is no longer its own state: that case (students, no slot) is the red Empty.
3. **Open class detail:** Load Class + Teacher + Schedules + Enrollment count.
4. **Block calendar:** Render Schedule entries as blocks on a Mon-Fri grid.
5. **Add/edit schedule block:** Create or update Schedule record. Optionally link classroom.
6. **Delete class:** Cascade delete Schedules, withdraw all Enrollments, cancel future Sessions.
7. **Add class:** Create Class with enrolled=0, teacher="Unassigned", empty schedule.

---

```

**Data flows:**
1. **Load week:** Query all Sessions for the visible week date range.
2. **Render blocks:** Position each session by day and time. Color by subject.
3. **Drag to move:** Update Session.date, start_time, end_time.
4. **Resize:** Update Session.end_time (or start_time for top edge).
5. **Add session:** Create Session with user-specified time/day/subject/teacher/room.

## 6. Auth & Profile System

### Flow:
```
Auth Screen ──► Profile Picker ──► PIN Modal ──► Dashboard
     │                                  │
     │                   Both owner and staff use PIN
     │                                  │
     └──── Login / Signup ──────────────┘
```

### Academy Setup Flow:
```
Signup ──► Profile Picker (empty) ──► Create Owner Profile (locked role) ──► Success ──► Dashboard
                                   │
                                   └── Owner sets: name, picture, 4-digit PIN
                                       Role toggle is HIDDEN (always owner)
```

### Data:
- **Login:** Email + password → authenticate User record → load academy's profiles
- **Signup:** Create Academy + AcademySettings + Subscription (starter tier) → redirect to profiles (empty) → force owner profile creation
- **Profile picker:** List all active Users for the academy, showing role badges. Empty state shows "Create your first profile" CTA.
- **PIN verification:** 4-digit PIN for ALL roles (owner + staff) → hash and compare with User.pin_hash → on success, set current session user
- **Profile creation:** Owner-only — requires owner PIN to authorize. Owner creates profiles from Settings flyout.

### Profile Picture:
- Stored as: `{ type: 'preset', colors: [hex1, hex2] }` or `{ type: 'upload', dataUrl: 'data:image/...' }`
- Preset: 8 color gradient pairs rendered as circular avatar with initials
- Upload: Custom image, max 2MB, stored as base64 data URL (or S3 URL in production)

### Security:
- Owner PIN is required for login (not password-only bypass)
- Staff PINs are hashed, never stored in plaintext
- Every action after PIN entry is attributed to that specific staff member
- Profile creation requires owner PIN — staff cannot create profiles

---

## 7. Attendance & Check-in/out Flow

### Check-in (Manual):
```
Staff selects profile → enters PIN → opens session → clicks student → marks present
    │
    ├── Update SessionStudent.is_present = true
    ├── Set SessionStudent.checked_in_at = now()
    ├── Set SessionStudent.checked_in_by = current_user.id
    └── Create ActivityLog entry: type=checkin, action=checked_in
```

### Check-out (Auto at scheduled end):
```
Session end_time reached
    │
    ├── IF auto_checkout_enabled:
    │     For each SessionStudent where is_present=true AND checked_out_at is null:
    │       Set checked_out_at = session.end_time
    │
    ├── IF end_class_popup_enabled:
    │     Show "Is the class done?" toast → Yes/No
    │       Yes → mark session status=completed
    │       No → keep status=in_progress, extend visually
    │
    └── Create ActivityLog entry: type=checkin, action=checked_out
```

### Manual check-out (early):
```
Staff clicks check-out on student
    │
    ├── Set SessionStudent.checked_out_at = now()
    └── Create ActivityLog entry
```

---

## 8. Billing & Payment Architecture

### Billing Lifecycle:
```
PaymentPlan created
    │
    ├── Student enrolled in class
    │     │
    │     └── StudentBilling created
    │           │
    │           ├── status = "due" (not yet paid)
    │           │     │
    │           │     ├── paid → status = "paid", paid_date set
    │           │     │     └── PaymentLog created
    │           │     │
    │           │     └── due_date passes → status = "overdue"
    │           │           │
    │           │           ├── Notification sent (overdue alert)
    │           │           └── ActivityLog entry: payment_overdue
    │           │
    │           └── cycle_end reached → new StudentBilling created for next cycle
    │
    └── Payment recorded
          ├── PaymentLog created (amount, method, recorded_by)
          ├── StudentBilling.paid_amount updated
          └── If paid_amount >= amount_da → status = "paid"
```

### Status Derivation:
```
Student.status = LATEST StudentBilling.status
    │
    ├── If no billing records → "paid" (default)
    ├── If latest billing status = "paid" → "paid"
    ├── If latest billing status = "due" → "due"
    └── If latest billing status = "overdue" → "overdue"
```

### Renewal:
```
cycle_end reached
    │
    ├── Create new StudentBilling record:
    │     payment_plan_id = current plan
    │     amount_da = plan.amount_da
    │     status = "due"
    │     cycle_start = old cycle_end
    │     cycle_end = cycle_start + plan.duration_days
    │     due_date = cycle_start + plan.duration_days
    │
    └── Notification: "Renewal due for {student_name}"
```

### Aging Buckets (for overdue display):
```
Overdue accounts bucketed by days overdue:
    ├── 1–7 days overdue   → "recent"
    ├── 8–30 days overdue  → "aging"
    └── 30+ days overdue   → "critical"
```

---

## 9. Teacher Payroll Architecture

### Hourly Contract:
```
TeacherHoursLog records:
    ├── session_id → Session
    ├── hours = session.end_time - session.start_time
    └── logged_by = staff who confirmed the session

Monthly payroll:
    total_hours = SUM(TeacherHoursLog.hours) WHERE date in period
    calculated_amount = total_hours × teacher.hourly_rate
```

### Per-Student Contract:
```
Active students = COUNT(Student) WHERE:
    ├── student is enrolled in a class taught by this teacher
    └── enrollment.status = 'active'

Monthly payroll:
    total_students = active student count
    calculated_amount = total_students × teacher.per_student_rate
```

### Payroll Lifecycle:
```
Month starts
    │
    ├── Payroll record created (status=pending)
    │
    ├── Hours/Students accumulated throughout month
    │
    ├── Month ends → calculated_amount finalized
    │     │
    │     ├── Owner marks as settled → status=settled, paid_date set
    │     │
    │     └── If not settled by threshold → status=overdue
    │
    └── ActivityLog entry: payment_received / payment_overdue
```

## 10. Calendar & Scheduling System

### Dashboard Calendar (Read-Only)
The Dashboard tab includes a **read-only** calendar view for quick schedule overview:
- **Day/Week toggle** — switch between single-day and full-week view
- **No editing** — blocks are click-only (opens session detail panel)
- **No drag/resize** — purely informational
- **Now-line** — thin red horizontal line at current time
- **Subject color coding** — blocks colored by class.color

### Calendar Page (Full Editor)
The Calendar tab is the **primary scheduling interface** with full drag-and-drop:

#### Sidebar Subject Palette
```
Left sidebar (180px):
    ├── Subject cards (draggable from palette)
    │     Each card shows: grip icon + colored chip with subject name
    │     Color comes from class.color field
    │
    ├── "Add subject" dashed card → opens AddSubjectModal
    │     (name + color picker with 8 presets + custom)
    │
    └── Instructions hint text

Default palette subjects (seeded from Class records):
    Math (#b3872a), French (#7c3aed), English (#0ea5e9), Science (#0f6b4d)
    + any custom subjects added by user
```

#### Drag-to-Create Flow
```
1. User drags a subject card from sidebar onto the grid
2. Grid highlights drop target (green tint)
3. On drop:
   ├── Calculate time from drop Y position (snapped to 5-min grid)
   ├── Open CreateSessionModal with:
   │     subject = dragged subject name
   │     color = subject color
   │     date = target day column
   │     startTime = snapped drop time
   │     endTime = startTime + 1hr (default)
   └── User fills in teacher, room, adjusts times if needed
4. On submit: POST /sessions → new session appears on grid
```

#### Edge-Resize on Blocks
```
Existing blocks have invisible resize handles at top/bottom edges:
    .resize-handle.top (cursor: ns-resize)
    .resize-handle.bottom (cursor: ns-resize)

On mousedown on handle:
    ├── Track mouse delta from start position
    ├── Snap to 5-minute grid (SNAP_MIN = 5)
    ├── Top edge: adjust start_time, maintain end_time
    ├── Bottom edge: adjust end_time, maintain start_time
    ├── Enforce minimum 5-minute duration
    └── On mouseup: PATCH /sessions/:id → update times
```

#### Drag-to-Move Blocks
```
Existing blocks are draggable:
    ├── On dragstart: store session ID + original position
    ├── On drop on different day/time column:
    │     Calculate new day + time from drop position
    │     Snap to 5-minute grid
    │     PATCH /sessions/:id → update date + start_time
    └── End time adjusts to maintain duration
```

#### View Modes
```
Day:   Single column for today, full height
Week:  7 columns (Sun-Sat), standard view
Month: Simple grid overview with event chips
```

### Calendar Grid Rendering:
```
Grid: 7 columns (Sun-Sat) × 13 rows (8AM-9PM)
Hour height: 60px (1px = 1 minute)
Snap: 5 minutes (5px) — 5-minute granularity
Min session duration: 5 minutes (5px)

Block positioning:
    top = ((start_minutes - 480) / 60) × 60px
    height = ((end_minutes - start_minutes) / 60) × 60px
    left = day_column_index × column_width
```

### Recurring vs. One-time:
```
Schedule (recurring):
    class_id + day_of_week + start_time + end_time
    │
    └── Generates Sessions each week:
          For each active week in term:
            Create Session with:
              date = next occurrence of day_of_week
              start_time = schedule.start_time
              end_time = schedule.end_time
              teacher_id = class.teacher_id
              classroom_id = schedule.classroom_id

Custom Session (one-time):
    Created directly via drag-to-create on Calendar page
    schedule_id = null
    All fields specified manually via CreateSessionModal
```

### Subject Palette (Extensible)
```
Subjects are NOT hardcoded strings. They are an extensible palette:

1. Default subjects seeded from Class records:
   Each unique class.subject value becomes a palette card
   Color comes from class.color

2. Custom subjects added via AddSubjectModal:
   name + color → stored in Subject entity
   Appears in sidebar palette for drag-to-create

3. Subject entity (optional, for persistence):
   id, academy_id, name, color, created_at
   If not persisted, palette is derived from Class records + session subjects

Benefits:
   - Visual consistency (same color for same subject across calendar)
   - Drag-to-create is fast (one drag + drop)
   - New subjects can be added without touching class definitions
   - Color wheel picker allows custom branding per subject
```

## 11. Activity Log & Audit Trail

### What gets logged:

| Action | Entity | Log Type | Example Text |
|---|---|---|---|
| Student check-in | SessionStudent | checkin | "Student check-in — Yasmine B." |
| Student check-out | SessionStudent | checkin | "Student check-out — Anes K." |
| Payment received | StudentBilling | payment | "Payment received — Karim M." |
| New student enrolled | Student | student | "New student enrolled — Sofia L." |
| Payment overdue | StudentBilling | alert | "Payment overdue — Sarah A." |
| Session scheduled | Session | session | "New session scheduled — Math" |
| Student removed | Student | alert | "Student profile removed — Amine F." |
| Attendance confirmed | Session | checkin | "Attendance confirmed — Math session" |

### Attribution:
Every ActivityLog entry carries `user_id` — the staff member who performed the action. This is the core accountability feature: since staff must enter their PIN before any action, the log proves who did what.

### Retention:
- Activity logs are kept for the lifetime of the academy
- Old logs can be exported as CSV from Settings → Data & Export
- Logs are ordered by created_at descending (newest first)
- UI shows last 30 entries, with "load more" pagination

## P.S. — Profile Creation & Academy Setup Flow

> **Only the owner can create profiles.** Profile creation is gated behind owner authentication (PIN verification).

### First-Time Academy Setup

When a new academy is created via signup, the flow is:

```
1. User signs up with academy name, email, password
2. System creates Academy record → authScene = 'profiles'
3. ProfilePicker shows empty state: "Welcome to Vinta School OS"
4. User clicks "Create your first profile"
5. CreateProfileModal opens with lockedRole = 'owner' (role toggle hidden)
6. Owner fills in: name, profile picture, PIN (required)
7. On submit → Owner enters dashboard via success screen
8. Owner is the ONLY profile — no staff profiles exist yet
```

### Creating Additional Profiles (From Settings)

After the initial owner setup, new profiles are created from the **Settings** panel:

```
1. Owner opens Settings flyout → "Manage profiles"
2. Clicks "Add profile" → CreateProfileModal opens (role toggle visible)
3. Owner enters their OWN PIN to authorize profile creation
4. Fills in: name, picture, role (owner/staff), phone, PIN (4-digit)
5. Staff PIN is used for action attribution in the system
6. Owner PIN is used for login authentication
```

### Key Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Owner PIN | Required — used to log in to the owner account |
| Staff PIN | Required — used to attribute actions (check-ins, payments, etc.) |
| Profile creation | Owner-only — requires owner PIN to authorize |
| First profile | Always owner — role is locked during academy setup |
| Profile picture | Optional — preset color avatars or custom image upload |
| Max profiles | Determined by subscription tier (Starter: 3, Pro: 10, Scale: unlimited) |

### Auth Flow Summary

```
Academy Signup → Profile Picker (empty) → Create Owner Profile (PIN) → Success → Dashboard
